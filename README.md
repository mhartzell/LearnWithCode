# LearnWithCode
The best way to learn about code is to write code!  As developers, it's all too easy to let our skills atrophy.  The development world is also a constant barrage of information: new tech, new tools, new approaches and new ways to solve problems.

I created this repository for myself to engage in continuous learning.  Here you will find all manner of things, all implemented in code: design patterns, algorithms, data structures, one-off coding exercises and more.  Use them as you see fit!
